## While Loops

While Loop is used to iterate a part of the program repeatedly until the specified Boolean condition is true. When the boolean condition becomes false loop will stop.

```java
public class Example {  
public static void main(String[] args) {  
    int i=1;  
    while(i<=5){
        System.out.println(i);
        i++;
        }
    }  
}

Output:
1
2
3
4
5
```
