## Non-Primitive Data Types
**Non-primitive data types** can be created or modified by programmers.  
In **Non-Primitive Data Type** we have many different types like:
1. Class - Class is a user-defined data type that is used to create objects. A class contains a set of properties and methods that are common and exhibited by all the objects of the class. 

2. Array - Arrays are non-primitive data types in Java that are used to store elements of the same data type in a contiguous manner. They are not pre-defined and users have to declare and initialize arrays by themselves.
```java
int[] arr= new int[5]; //delcared array arr of size 5
int arr1[]={1,2,3,4,5}; //declared an array arr1with defined values
``` 
3. String - Strings in Java are designed in such a way that they can hold a sequence of characters in a single variable, unlike character arrays where there are separate char entities. There is no need to end strings in Java with the null character which is compulsory in the case of C/C++.
```java
String str = "Hello"; //delcared an string str of value hello
```
4. Interface -Interace in Java is a tool to achieve abstraction. Interface can contain non-implemented methods (without the method body) also known as abstract methods.
